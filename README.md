## 👋 About Me

I am an aspiring data scientist with a Master’s degree, where my thesis focused on **human-AI interaction**—exploring how explainable AI (XAI) can enhance decision-making and trust in complex systems. I am passionate about combining **machine learning**, **user-centric design**, and **data storytelling** to derive actionable insights from real-world datasets. My projects reflect a commitment to both strong analytical thinking and communicative clarity.

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🧬 Cirrhosis Patient Survival Prediction
> [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Ykomash/ML_Projects/blob/main/Cirrhosis_Patient_Survival_Prediction.ipynb)

Developed a survival analysis model using **Random Forests** and the **Cox Proportional Hazards model** to predict patient outcomes based on medical records. Employed **feature engineering**, **missing data imputation**, and **Kaplan-Meier estimators** to derive clinically interpretable survival curves.

**Keywords**: `Survival Analysis`, `Random Forest`, `Cox Regression`, `Kaplan-Meier`, `Data Preprocessing`, `Scikit-Learn`, `Lifelines`
